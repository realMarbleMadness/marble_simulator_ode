The main code we need to care about is stored in the `/ball1` folder. Detailed explanation see `notes.txt`.

## How to install all the dependencies

1. Download [ode](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opende/files/) and put it somewhere (hopefully not your `/Downloads` folder)
2. `cd` into the ode folder, then run `./configure --enable-double-precision`. Note the double precision here that takes me (Yanda) an hour to debug
3. edit `drawstuff/src/drawstuff.cpp`, change line #79 to `#define LIGHTY (-0.4f)`
4. `make` then `sudo make install`
5. `sudo cp -rp include/drawstuff /usr/local/include/`
6. `cd drawstuff/src/`
7. `sudo cp libdrawstuff.la .libs/libdrawstuff.a /usr/local/lib/`

## See the demo

1. `git clone` this repo into your catkin workspace `/src` folder
2. `cd` into catkin workspace, then `catkin_make` 
3. `roslaunch marble_simulator_ode default_simulator.launch`

## Extra notes about the code
- the `CMakeLists.txt` is a masterpiece
- The `configs/cxxxx.txt` are obstacle configurations. Every line represents a rectangle, where each line contains dimentions, position and angle.
